# ft-transcendence_template

Simple template for the 42 project `ft_transcendence`.

This template includes a basic setup for a web application using:
- `ViteJS` for the frontend
- `Fastify` for the backend
- `SQLlite` for the database
- `Docker` for containerization
- `Docker Compose` for orchestration
- `TypeScript` for type safety (both frontend and backend, might need to setup tRPC)
- HOT reloading for development
- API wrapper for the backend (in api.js file on frontend)
- `TailwindCSS` for styling

Tutorial on how to use it, will come soon since this is not quite finish yet...
